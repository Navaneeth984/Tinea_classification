## 📘 Project Overview
**Tinea** (commonly known as *ringworm*) refers to a group of fungal skin infections that can affect various parts of the body. This project demonstrates how **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques can be used to **automatically detect and classify Tinea infections from skin images**, enabling faster diagnosis and clinical decision support.

This repository contains the complete **Google Colab Notebook** used for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an efficient CNN-based model to classify Tinea infections.  
- Apply data augmentation to handle limited and imbalanced datasets.  
- Evaluate the model with performance metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Create a reproducible, modular workflow suitable for dermatology image analysis.
